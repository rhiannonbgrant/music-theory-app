# music-theory-app
A music theory web application passion project built with Vanilla Javascript for the purpose of fun and education.

The plan is to expand this app to include games that will teach you to be able to differentiate different:
- Pitches
- Intervals
- Chords
- And other musical concepts

At the moment, I just building a simple test format but hoping to gamify it overtime.
